NAME

    logger - log messages

SYNOPSIS

    logger string ...

DESCRIPTION

    The logger utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and format,
containing the string operands provided by the user. The messages are
expected to be evaluated later by personnel performing system administration
tasks.

    It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales other
than the POSIX locale are effective.

OPTIONS

    None.

OPERANDS

    The following operand shall be supported:

    string
        One of the string arguments whose contents are concatenated together,
in the order specified, separated by single <space>s.

STDIN

    Not used.

INPUT FILES

    None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables shall affect the execution of logger:

    LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)
    LC_ALL
        If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
    LC_CTYPE
        Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
characters in arguments).
    LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error. (This means
diagnostics from logger to the user or application, not diagnostic messages
that the user is sending to the system administrator.)
    NLSPATH
        [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

    Default.

STDOUT

    Not used.

STDERR

    The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES

    Unspecified.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

    None.

EXIT STATUS

    The following exit values shall be returned:

     0
        Successful completion.
    >0
        An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

    Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE

    This utility allows logging of information for later use by a system
administrator or programmer in determining why non-interactive utilities have
failed. The locations of the saved messages, their format, and retention
period are all unspecified. There is no method for a conforming application
to read messages, once written.

EXAMPLES

    A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to read a
configuration file and fails; it may attempt to notify the system
administrator with:

    logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]

RATIONALE

    The standard developers believed strongly that some method of alerting
administrators to errors was necessary. The obvious example is a batch
utility, running non-interactively, that is unable to read its configuration
files or that is unable to create or write its results file. However, the
standard developers did not wish to define the format or delivery mechanisms
as they have historically been (and will probably continue to be) very
system-specific, as well as involving functionality clearly outside the scope
of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

    The text with LC_MESSAGES about diagnostic messages means diagnostics
from logger to the user or application, not diagnostic messages that the user
is sending to the system administrator.

    Multiple string arguments are allowed, similar to echo, for ease-of-use.

    Like the utilities mailx and lp, logger is admittedly difficult to test.
This was not deemed sufficient justification to exclude these utilities from
this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. It is also arguable that they are, in
fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not portable.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    None.
