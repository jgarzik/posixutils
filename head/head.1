NAME

    head - copy the first part of files

SYNOPSIS

    head [-n number][file...]

DESCRIPTION

    The head utility shall copy its input files to the standard output,
ending the output for each file at a designated point.

    Copying shall end at the point in each input file indicated by the -n
number option. The option-argument number shall be counted in units of lines.

OPTIONS

    The head utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

    The following option shall be supported:

    -n  number
        The first number lines of each input file shall be copied to standard
output. The application shall ensure that the number option-argument is a
positive decimal integer.

    When a file contains less than number lines, it shall be copied to
standard output in its entirety. This shall not be an error.

    If no options are specified, head shall act as if -n 10 had been
specified.

OPERANDS

    The following operand shall be supported:

    file
        A pathname of an input file. If no file operands are specified, the
standard input shall be used.

STDIN

    The standard input shall be used only if no file operands are specified.
See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES

    Input files shall be text files, but the line length is not restricted to
{LINE_MAX} bytes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    The following environment variables shall affect the execution of head:

    LANG
        Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)
    LC_ALL
        If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
    LC_CTYPE
        Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
characters in arguments and input files).
    LC_MESSAGES
        Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
    NLSPATH
        [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for
the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS

    Default.

STDOUT

    The standard output shall contain designated portions of the input files.

    If multiple file operands are specified, head shall precede the output
for each with the header:

    "\n==> %s <==\n", <pathname>

    except that the first header written shall not include the initial
<newline>.

STDERR

    The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES

    None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

    None.

EXIT STATUS

    The following exit values shall be returned:

     0
        Successful completion.
    >0
        An error occurred.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

    Default.

The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE

    The obsolescent - number form is withdrawn in this version. Applications
should use the -n number option.

EXAMPLES

    To write the first ten lines of all files (except those with a leading
period) in the directory:

    head *

RATIONALE

    Although it is possible to simulate head with sed 10q for a single file,
the standard developers decided that the popularity of head on historical BSD
systems warranted its inclusion alongside tail.

    This standard version of head follows the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The
-n option was added to this new interface so that head and tail would be more
logically related.

    There is no -c option (as there is in tail) because it is not historical
practice and because other utilities in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
provide similar functionality.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

    None.
